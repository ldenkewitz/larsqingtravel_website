<p>My trip in the Philippines ended in Manila again. There I meet other old colleagues who I haven't seen for two years. I was very happy to see them again, especially one of them. He's name is James. He was a team member of our project. During those hectic days, he was one of the two members who kept working with them easy. He always knew what he was doing, he always delivered on time, and he always explained his ideas clearly. When the project was under tight schedule, he was the one who was willing to put extra effort. As a new project manager working with busy experienced experts, I was thankful that we had a team member like him. <img src="images/philippines2014/ColleaguesManila.jpg" alt="[Picture Qing with colleagues in Manila.jpg]"></p>

<p>All together, we went to their favourite Filipino restaurant. There, they ordered food that I've never seen during my one month's time in the Philippines. They were diverse and delicious. Yes, that's another thing I noticed from travelling: locals knows what to eat. </p>
