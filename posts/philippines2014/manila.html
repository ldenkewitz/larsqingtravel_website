<p>A colleague I met 2 years ago picked me up at the airport. It was raining. 
</p><p>
I was happy that I didn't need to walk under this heavy rain with my backpack to look for buses and coordinate around the city. 
</p><p>
We drove around the city and finally arrived at his apartment, which he shares with his younger brother. 
</p><p>
It was a small apartment in a big building. Probably like many apartments in many Asian countries for the young professionals, the apartment was very compacted. There was a bed with an upper and a lower layer, a couch next to the bed, and a TV placed in front of the couch. Next to the TV, there is also a small desk with computers and books on it. At the entrance of the apartment, a small area with a gas cooker and a couple of pots formed the kitchen. 
</p><p>
I felt the life and a feeling of home in this place, which was full of daily stuffs that one shall accumulate over years of living at the same place.
</p><p>
With the air-con turned on, the air was cold and humid.
</p><p>
For I was going to share their home with them for a couple of days, they placed a self-made 'curtain' over the lower layer of the bed for me. Very sweet.

There I spent days with these two warm-hearted boys in the big massive Manila. There were parts of the city made me think of the California I saw in movies. There were parts of the city full of people, noise, markets, and colourful jeepneys. We toured the tourist attractions, wandered in night markets, seen the beautiful view of volcano, and shared our cooking skills. <img src="images/philippines2014/toursManila.jpg" alt="[Pictures of touring in Manila.jpg]"></p>

<p>From their national food Adobo to some grilled Pao that resembles a Chinese dish, from the Halo Halo to Dunkin Donuts, I tried and enjoyed many of the Filipino dishes.  
</p><p>
I know, without them, I would have been lost in this big massive Manila. <img src="images/philippines2014/cookingManila.jpg" alt="[Picture of cooking in Manila.jpg]"></p>
