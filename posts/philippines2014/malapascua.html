Here I met Lars. 
</p><p>
Like every time I visit an island, I didn't book any accommodation. The same as last time, a local guy helped me to find a cheap room. And this time, he was also trying to help me find a cheap good place to dive. We went into many dive shops, and none of them was satisfactory. Until we came across this one. 
</p><p>
It's a dive shop very far from where I live. I think we needed to drive across a small hill on motorbike to get there. Anyway, we went there, and that was the first time I saw Lars. I was standing there waiting to talk to the staff. Lars was around. I think he smiled at me or said hello or something. It felt friendly. "Hmm, this place has a friendly environment." I noted to myself. Later, I talked to the dive shop manager, she was good, professional and offered me a good package price. I decided to dive there. 
</p><p>
On the next day, all the divers boarded on the same boat to go to the same dive site. There were about ten of us. As usual, I started to observe everyone. Lars appeared to be a bit funny, or wired in a funny way to me. Anyway, it was a bit different from the others. He looked around here and there and it seemed like he was planning or wondering about something. He didn't always sit straight or behave in a serious way as the others. He looked more like a traveller. He could have belonged to the 'dodgy' group. 
</p><p>
During one break of the many dives, we started to talk. Then I learnt that we had similar background, similar experiences, and similar reasons to start long-term travelling. Yes, he felt close and very easy to talk to. Later that day, Lars and me made a tour around almost the whole island. That was a very good time. I think during the entire tour, we almost never stopped talking. There was beautiful sea and beautiful sunset. There was a woman whose house was damaged by typhoon and we wanted to help. There was the sea water full of shinning sparkling fishes that we could jump into. There were many crabs and many chasing of the crabs. There was a light house. And there were fisherman's wife and kids preparing fishnet by sticking thousands of tiny fishes onto the net. Our tour of the island lasted until late at night. At such a late hour, in a local restaurant, the way he made his order just made me and the waitress couldn't stop laughing. At that time, I had no idea that he was serious about his ordering.

That day, he dropped me in front of my hostel. I liked his red raining jacket and the big warm good night hug. For a long time, that was the image I had when I thought of him. The big Lars in the big red jacket. <img src="images/philippines2014/QingLarsMalapascua.jpg" alt="[Picture of Lars and Qing in Malapascua]"/></p>

Malapascua is famous for its thresher sharks. It's the kind of shark whose tail is pointing up and is almost as long as its body. It's very cute for being a shark. We made quite an effort to try to see them. First dive. We stayed at the same spot surrounded by sand and darkness for more than half an hour. We didn't see anything. We dove again. We stayed in some sandy and rocky area for about twenty minutes. Luckily, some one of us made a signal. He spotted a shark! The dive master gathered everyone around. But by the time I hurried there, the shark stayed for only a few minutes before he faded into the deep dark ocean. <img src="images/philippines2014/sharkMalapascua.jpg" alt="[Picture Thresher shark in Malapascua.jpg]"/> </p>
