My trip continued to Sabang bay, Puerto Galera. I went there because of its diving. 
</p><p>
That was the beginning of my real solo travelling. I was a little worried. I wasn't sure if I would be able to have a good time. 
</p><p>
I didn't pre-book any accommodation before I set my foot on this island. I wanted to keep my choice free. A small boat with 'spider legs' approached the shore, we walked onto the jetty. A mid-aged woman walked towards me. <img src="images/philippines2014/redHorseSabang.jpg" alt="[Picture of the red horses in Sabang.jpg]"></p>

<p>"Do you need room?" She asked me. 
</p><p>
I liked her energy. It felt kind. I said yes, and told her that I need a cheap accommodation. Then I followed her. 
</p><p>
We walked into the town, passed through the busy noisy club area, and turned into an area full of white painted individual houses. The place looked compact, one house next to the other. We entered one of them, and talked to the owner. It wasn't high season, some renovation was going on in the house, and I was able to get a fair price for my stay there. 
</p><p>
On the same night, I got lost. 
</p><p>
I walked through the streets back and forth but couldn't find the turning point to the white housed area. I started to feel a little worried and afraid. "Do you speak Chinese?" A sound attracted my attention and I turned around. I saw a Chinese standing in front of me. He was not tall, but looked pretty young. He told me that he was the owner of a Chinese diving shop on the island. He noticed that I was looking for somewhere. I told him the name of my stay, and he leaded me there. One the way, we passed through his dive master students' resident. I saw a big group of young Chinese eating, drinking and chatting around a table. I felt happy and relaxed. If I don't have anything to do the next night, I could come and join them. 
</p><p>
	The next day started with diving. 
</p><p>
I think at that time, I missed diving. I missed the feeling of being under the water, everything become so calm and quiet. In the whole world, the only thing you can hear is the sound of your bubbles, and all you see are the underwater creatures swimming or laying around you. 
</p><p>
I didn't plan which dive sites to dive in, I just wanted to dive. <img src="images/philippines2014/divingSabang.jpg" alt="[Picture of Qing diving in Sabang.jpg]"></p>

<p>The dives were not disappointing, as well as the people. Every time after we finished a night dive, we would expect the manager waiting and welcoming us with a big jar of beer. I met a group of divers and we connected strangely well. We learnt together how to crack a huge fat crab with a tiny hammer, we stayed at the same spot under the water for 30 minutes just to wait and see the mandarin fish for 5 seconds, we seated on the top of a jeepney to visit the waterfall. We had nice talks and funny activities. Before our departure, one of us made bracelets for each of us, with a diver's sign and our group name - "dodgy".  
</p><p>
I wished we had more time together. <img width="740px" src="images/philippines2014/jeepneySabang.jpg" alt="[Picture of trip on Jeepney in Sabang.jpg]"></p>
