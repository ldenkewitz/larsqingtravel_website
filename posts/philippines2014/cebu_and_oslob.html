He replied my Couchsurfing request within half an hour with a SMS and a smiley.

He is from Sweden and had been travelling for nearly 2 years. At that moment, he rented a room and had stayed in the Philippines for quite a while. We meet around an IT industrial area and walked into an area full of small houses. There was his room and another room of his house mate. His room wasn't big, around 25 square meters I guess. And at the moment, he was hosting two couch surfers and one more is going to arrive. We all slept on the floor on mattresses, while he had a tiny small bed for himself. He is a hard-core traveler. He told us his travelling principle, never pay for accommodation and transportation. I was surprised, and was also amazed about the fact that it was possible to travel in this way. By far, I've only heard about it from TV.

Together with another couch surfer, we had quite a lot of laugh, which I don't remember for what reason any more. But one thing still stays fresh in my mind. That is a coconut. We discovered this coconut in a super market, whose face somehow resembled the face of a grandpa of a carrot. We called him grandpa coconut. We took him to the tourist attractions, posed and created many pictures. <img src="images/philippines2014/Coconut_cebu_double.jpg" alt="[Picture of Grandpa Coconut.jpg]"></p>

<p>The arrival to Cebu City was amazing. It was on a boat where you can sleep over nights. Everyone slept on layered beds in the open area. There was no lock, no furniture, just simple beds. Surprisingly, the night was comfortable and peaceful. People woke up early in the morning. I joined them and walked to the edge of the boat. There, at that moment, I was stunned by the beautiful view of the morning sea unfolded in front of me. I had been on many boats and had seen many seas, but that one, I had to say, was the most beautiful one I've ever seen. The calmness, strength and softness of the sea were well blended. Together with a golden touch from the morning sun, you see, she is waking up. <img src="images/philippines2014/sunriseCebuSea1.jpg" alt="[Pictures of Sunrise in Cebu.jpg]"></p>

<p>In Cebu City, many people were telling me about one place: Oslob. There you can snorkel or dive with Whale Sharks, which is the largest fish species in the world. Interested by the excitement on their face when they talked about this experience, I decided to give Oslob a visit. I borrowed by host's tent and went on the trip. In one of the beach hotels, the owner let me put my tent in one of their huts and charged me a very little amount. There, for the first time, I learned how to set up a tent. It was windy at night, but my tent was safe. :)

On the next day, very early in the morning, groups of people in blue uniforms started to collect people from different hotels and transform us to the whale shark watching center. Little boats, with five or six people, were coming and going one after another, like products being transformed on a streamline in a factory. After received some basic environment conservation and safety instructions, our boat followed others to an area where many boast were stationed. As we went close by, I saw that on each boat there was a fisherman, who constantly threw something into the water. Around them, there were many whale sharks. Little boats like ours, loaded with tourists, drove into the area, and unloaded the tourists. I could hear people shouting and laughing, I could see them jumping in and out of the water. Yes, they were excited.  But me, no, I felt bad. I felt so bad that I wanted to leave the place right away. This wasn't the nature I wanted to see. I didn't feel that I was in a sea, but at a zoo instead. I knew these sharks were totally free. They just came here for their daily food. Even the whole route for them to swim here were well protected. But this crowded feeding, crowded visiting, and this crowded man-made interaction with these beautiful natural creatures, made me feel bad.

Surprisingly, this marked my worst experience when interacting with nature. <img src="images/philippines2014/Oslob1.jpg" alt="[Pictures of Whale Sharks in Oslob]">	</p>
