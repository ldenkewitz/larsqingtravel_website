After the Sabang bay, I had a decision to make, whether to go west and take a 7 hours boat to the famous beautiful Palawan, or to go east and down to Cebu. At that time of the year, typhoons were still around. Locals told me that there were strong winds and high waves at the east side of the island. So I had to leave the famous beautiful Palawan in this trip, and head directly down to Cebu.

On my way, I crossed Philippines' No.1 island Boracay. I stayed there for 2 nights and I didn't like it. Like every time and for everyone, to enjoy or not enjoy a place, it depends a bit of luck. And I didn't have it at this time.  The beach was stunningly beautiful. I walked along the beach hoping to find a quiet place to sit down, have a drink and read a book. That wasn't possible. All the caf√©s and restaurants along the beach were fancy and were at least 10 meters away from the beach, with a wall made from plastic bags in between. It was crowded and commercial. <img src="images/philippines2014/boracayBeach.jpg" alt="[Picture of the Beach in Boracay.jpg]"></p>

<p>Being satisfied by having looked at the stunning Boracay beach, I continued my journey towards Cebu. I had to make a stop at Iloilo. Knowing nothing about the city, I sent my first solo Couchsurfing quests to Iloilo and a girl accepted me.

She was calm, kind and confident. I waited for her in front of a shopping mall. She leaded me to her home.

She lived with her parents and they were blind. That was my first encounter with blind people. They had a normal and peaceful life. I looked at her cooking simple food for her parents, taking care of them. They didn't talk much, but I saw trust, love and responsibilities.

My intended one day stay extended to four, because of the pouring rain and because of her and her friends. We spent a lot of time in her room. I liked her room. It was also a room that could show that the owner had been living there for a long time. But this time, with a different style. She used simple and natural things to decorate her room. It was spacey, and it made me feel relaxed and free. <img src="images/philippines2014/roomIloilo.jpg" alt="[Picture of Couch Host's room in Iloilo.jpg]"></p>

<p>We read books, shared music, videos, movies, and had long talks. I visited a mango plantation, saw endless mango trees and brought back the sweetest mangos in the whole world. Oh, and there's one more highlight: her friends made me some cookies that forever ended my curiosity to a certain spice in this world. </p>
