<p>In Yogyakarta we meet Adolf. 
</p><p>
Lars and I decided to meet up again. When I saw him again at the petrol station, he was tall, taller than what I had in my mind. That surprised me. 
</p><p>
He leaded me to his borrowed manual motorbike. It was huge. Maybe it wasn’t so huge for his height, but for a motorbike, it was. I got on the bike with my backpack. He accelerated. Oh, my! I was suddenly pulled by a strong force. I felt my bag was dragging me out of the motorbike. Yes, that was Lars’ way of riding in Yogyakarta. For days later, either in the busy city or on the winding mountains, he rode this way. Accelerates fast, stops fast, and breaks in a sudden. At that time, I was reckless enough to put my life into his hands. I barely knew him, but I trusted that if he was doing it, he must knew what he was doing.

When we finally arrived at Adolf’s house, I had a relief. After all these months, I don’t remember the details of meeting Adolf any more, nor my first impression of him. All I remember is that we had a good time. We had many interesting talks and a lot of fun. He knows quite a lot about a famous series of Chinese swordsman tales. I read them and liked them too. In addition to those fascinating stories, I guess he also understood and enjoyed the ancient Chinese philosophies behind them. Maybe that’s why he named my travelling teddy bear Du Gu Qiu Bai (独孤求败). What a “lovely” name, for such a cute bear. :)
</p><p>
I think he is also the kind of person who’s rare in the society. Listening to his stories, I would be amazed at how he could have done all these things, feeling envy about his experiences but never get jealous. For the level of his spirit of adventure, his gut for taking risks, and his tolerance of uncomfortableness, I would never reach anything that’s close by. What an amazing person and a good friend.

For him, Lars and I made my third toy on the trip.

Yogyakarta hosts two famous must see ancient temples, one Hindu, Prambanan, and one Buddhist, Borobudur. Travel guides recommend to see the sunrise at Borobudur, where you will see the sun rising over two volcanoes across a misty plain with Buddha statues in the foreground. But this early ticket is expensive. To see the same sun rising over the same volcanoes we went to the Punthuk Setumbu hills, where the temple tips of Borobudur became part of the panorama.

Being in the Philippines, looking at Google images of Indonesia, I was already attracted by its beauty, its feeling of rich culture, and its deep calmness. I guess there is something mysterious and spiritual about this country.
