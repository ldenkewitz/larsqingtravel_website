<p>Cartagena welcomed us with its heat, its festival and its safety challenges.</p>

<p>On our way from the airport to the center on a local bus, I was touched and amazed. Finally, after all the months' time in Europe and the US, with all the modern infrastructures, clean and organized streets, and well managed behaviors, I must say that I missed this chaos. I felt alive again on this tiny colorful bus which generated a strong shake every time it had to slow down, to speed up, or to make a turn. But I loved it. Looking out of the window, people were standing in groups and chatting, there were vendors selling street food, there were dirt and trashes around the corner, motorcycles were being used as vehicles, and loud music were screaming out from restaurants. All these seemed to be yelling to me: welcome to the world.	<img src="images/colombia2015/cartagena_bus.jpg" alt="[Pics of the bus]"/></p>

<p>I swam and dreamed in my self-imagined happiness until the bus was approaching the center. After one stop, one guy got on the bus and tried to sell us something. He acted aggressively and I felt afraid. I passed on the cash, which was the changes from buying the bus tickets, in my hand to Lars and he moved his attention to Lars as well. He talked to Lars for a long time. Rather than talking, I would describe his attitude more as pushing and threatening. This incident suddenly pulled me out of my dream. Yes, here is the reality. I may love and enjoy the vitality and diversity in a world like this, but also have to bear the consequences it brings. Finally he got off the bus. Another local passenger started to try to tell us something. We didn't fully understand his rapid Spanish, but one thing I thought we understood. That was when he formed his hand to the shape of a gun and pointed it towards his head.</p>

<p>For the first time in our trip, we felt unsafe on the streets. We were constantly warned by locals to not show any valuables on the street, even under the bright daylight. We were told not to use our laptops at the front entrance of our hostel. We were suggested not to walk on the streets at night. So we used our mobile phones as GPS under the cover of a scarf. We hided in the small room behind the entrance of our hostel to use Wi-Fi. We started to head back from the city soon after the sun went down. And we brought the least possible things and cashes with us when we have to go out. But all these, were not comparable to the mental restlessness we felt in this city.</p>

<p>Lucky as we were, Cartagena was preparing for its Independence Day Festival when we arrived. Two days later, we experienced a Colombian parade and foam fights in its beautiful old town.<img src="images/colombia2015/cartagena_parade_triple.jpg" alt="[Pics of parade]"/></p>

I guess this is probably the main reason why Cartagena is the most visited and touristic city in Colombia. The old town has an official name as Cartagena's colonial walled city, and it was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1984. During the colonial period, it served a key role in administration and expansion of the Spanish empire.<img src="images/colombia2015/cartagena_oldtown_triple.jpg" alt="[Pics of the old town]"/></p>
