<p>One of the highlights of our time in Cartagena was a Rat Fight that happened between a rat, Lars, and a cat.</p>

<p>We stayed at a local hostel where people didn't speak English. The rooms were simple furnished.  When walking through the deep corridor of the house, we could see rooms pop up from both sides one after another. The air was warm and stuffy. We picked a big room where one could feel a bit more space and had a bit more light. The windows were made from several holes on the upper part of the wall.</p>

<p>It was cool enough at night. I fell asleep quickly and easily.</p>

<p>Suddenly, I was awaken by a feeling of horror. Lars suddenly jumped out of the bed to the middle of the room. "Oh, No, I thought it was you..." he shouted.</p>

<p>"What? Was the door open? Was someone in the room? Did we get robbed?"</p>

<p>"I totally thought it was you..." he continued. "But it was a RAT!"</p>

<p>"The rat was crawling on me. I could feel his claws..." "He walked on me... he walked on my legs...." "Why is a rat not afraid of human... why did he walk on me...?" "It was a big rat..."</p>

<p>Like this, Lars started his battle with this big scary mysterious rat.</p>

<p>He stared into the room in the middle of the night for (it felt) hours until he spotted the rat walked slowly and peacefully out of the room along a cable that stretched from a closet to the windows. He cleaned out all our food and trashes from the room. He cleaned and re-organized all the stuffs around the closet. Until one day, he brought back a cat from the street.</p>

<p>The cat appeared cutely and curiously. I guess she had no idea about her mission here, but just liked people and liked our room. We placed the cat near the closet, she ran towards the bed. We placed again the cat around the closet, she ran towards the other side of the bed. After several tries, her attention were finally drawn to the closet. She started to sniff. "Yes! She's smelling something! She's going to find the rat..." We were excited. She walked around the closet for several rounds and went into the open drawer. "Oh, look, she is going to get the rat... but... maybe the cat is too small and the rat is too big. It was really a big rat! She will get hurt..." We started to worry. Several minutes had passed and no sound came out from the closet. Our wonders and worries grew, while the cat walked out of the closet as nothing had happened.</p>

<p>That night, instead of a rat, we had a cat in our room. And yes, she kept us awake more than the rat did the night before.</p>

<p>In the end, Lars fixed the open drawer and no more cats or rats for the rest of our time in Cartagena. Life went back into peace and harmony. :)</p>
