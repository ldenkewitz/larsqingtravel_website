<p>In that place is a project called OBT (Organization for Basic Training) situated, I wanted to visit. The main focus of this project lays on teaching children basic English. It was nice to get shown the classes where even more advanced students taught the younger ones. It is important for the young rural population the learn how to speak English that accesses them a wide range of jobs in the tourism and the chance to get off the land, towards the city. Next to English they also teach arithmetic, Khmer (the local language) and a traditional/cultural class, including dance or music. It is run by almost only one person (Sophal) who is completely dependent on donations and volunteers to keep this project alive.<img src="images/cambodia2015/chiro.jpg" alt="[Picture of OBT]"></p>
