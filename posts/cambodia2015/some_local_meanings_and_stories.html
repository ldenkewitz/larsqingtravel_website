<p>Many of Sophals stories he told me very invented by my question for the Khmer Rouge and where they came from so fast, to do there
genocide. He told me the Khmer version, where they came from. The westernised or also said, the version of the winner, we're able to read everywhere because that's common sense. He said, that the former King Sihanouk and the Vietnamese revolutionist Ho Chi Min had an unofficial agreement. It included the free pass of Vietnamese troops in exchange for former Cambodian provinces, taken by Vietnam. Ho Chi Min played a second game by infiltrating the Cambodian border areas with his (hidden) soldiers. When Ho Chi Min died, he won the war, he infiltrated Cambodia it his communists but he didn't give back the provinces in return. Some years later, these infiltrators, controlled by Vietnam, started the red revolution in the bloody way we know. They let Khmer kill Khmer for a couple of years before the Vietnamese official troops came to pretend to be the friends and have rescued the Cambodian population. It seems, that they still have the power over the Cambodian government like a puppet on a string. The money on Cambodia floats in some private pockets but the biggest part of it to the "big brother" in the east. A too little amount is used to build up
and improve the state itself. This is also another reason, why the prices are that artificially high. Even local chicken he told me, is cheaper in Vietnam. This reminds me at the New Zealand Kiwi, which is cheaper in China than in NZ itself, even after its transportation over the sea. Anyway...he even told me that Angkor Wat is owned by Vietnamese so even this money floats east.

Another usual and since this time everywhere for me obvious fact (world wide!) is about the agricultural companies. How they act and how they made the farmers addicted to their seeds, chemicals and mono-cultures. Already many farmers got bankrupted or even worse (suicide...) because of their sick money making game on costs of everyone, not only the farmers! I met a Malaysian girl Pei, who is working for an NGO, facing exactly such problems and issues. She also approved these methods that are used globally. To break it down it is like that, that farmers have to use there propagated better and more efficient plants. That is already the beginning of the end. First of all, these plants are weaker and less adaptable (e.g. for our changing climate). They need tons of chemicals to survive, but with these chemicals - that the farmer also has to pay - we kill the surroundings as well as the soil itself. The next point is, they prevented the usage of the fruits as new seeds because with them it's not possible any longer, to grow new fruit plants. Means, the farmers are even more addicted to these companies because now they need to buy new seeds from them. And so on and so on... it is super sick but happens all around us, just everywhere except of our own garden and a few organic farms. Sophals own sister got also a victim of these methods and got in loan off several thousands of dollars.

One word to the kids and they school system. As I wrote is the money in everyone else hand but not in the Cambodias. It seems even not enough for a sustainable salary for the teachers to make a life. The governmental salary is just 50% for living. For the rest the teacher have to charge the pupils and that from the very early grade. So comes that the poorer parents even struggle with sending their kids to elementary school... That is why giving especially the kids in the countryside some additional education, is so important.
