<p>We visited one of the country's biggest killing fields, set up by the Khmer Rouge, near Phnom Penh. What happened there can be read at Wikipedia, but going there and listening to the rarely but very informative audio guide, created the depressive atmosphere. Whatever there are for reasons and conspiracies about the background, it is just the fact and should be a reminder for every human, that such cruel and inhuman happenings can take place everywhere at any time again. So even though we should be more wise and should have learned through our long history, there is still need for patience at any time.

It is like the Nazi General Hermann Goering in an interview to the Nuremburg Trails summarized: <br>
<i>" Naturally, the common people don't want war; neither in Russia nor in  England nor in America, nor for that matter in Germany. That is understood  [...] the people can always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have to do is tell them they are being attacked and denounce the pacifists for lack of patriotism and exposing the country to danger. It works the same way in any country. "</i></p>
