<p>Battambang was the only place during the whole journey, where we were able to find the real Cambodian prices for food. It's so strange why all the prices are so high there. I told my parents about Indonesia I were last year and how cheap it can be. And Cambodia supposed to be cheap too because it is a poor third world country. The opposite was the case! We even paid more in average than in the neighbour country Thailand, what is much more sophisticated in comparison. <br>
One problem is the usage of the currencies in Cambodia. As long you are not a local, you pay everywhere only in big/hard USD. There is no chance to get some Riel from the ATM at all. We only had smaller change in Riel. So they round up everything to the next USD. But even then it was too much to pay usually $15 in average for three dishes (even in Kuala Lumpur I pay $1-2 a meal).
<br> Ok Qing says, it is because we were only in the tourist areas but we were walking around the places....so yes, we were definitely in tourist places too, but for sure not the whole time...! Also in other points we made a quite contradictory experience so I think, we may go there again.</p>
