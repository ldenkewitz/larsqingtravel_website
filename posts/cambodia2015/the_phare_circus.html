<p>It is called Phare and is by far not a circus. <br> It is a really professional show, full of music, artistic, art, dance and acting. The actors of this show are former street kids who got a chance to train their specific art skill at the art school of Phare in Battambang. Due to the potential number of visitors, they moved their main show to Siem Reap. Another smaller one is taking place in Battambang, next to the school. The show was so impressive for myself, even though I already saw several shows like that during my life. This show felt so authentic and not artificial (too professional) although it was professional! <br> Next to the amazing skills of the actors, it was also the way how they presented it. At one point I also felt touched by the show and almost about to lose tears. Very nice! Everyone how is participating this show will become automatically a donator and supports the school project in Battambang. There they expanded the school over the time with much more buildings and subjects. Nowadays they offer accommodations for the students as well as an elementary school. </p>


Great project that gives the kids the opportunity to a better future, that is worth getting supported! Ah and the best students get employed by famous shows all around the world. <br>
