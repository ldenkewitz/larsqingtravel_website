What a luck I had, it became clear to my much later, to find this family I worked for as a "Willing Worker On Organic Farms".

After I solved my financial issues I left Auckland towards the North and ended up in Keri Keri. From my friend Erik I heard about the option to work as a WWOOFer and that it is a good start to get some local contacts and a smoother integration into the country and the language. After a few applications, a lady contacted me and wrote, she could pick me up from the hostel at the very next day and so she did. Back at her place, she (Di) showed me the house and garden, which should have been my playing ground for the next 14days. In the end it were 5weeks, exclusive the week at the end of my NZ trip.

It didn't take a long time and I was integrated into the whole family life. They really made me feel I'm a part of their family, so warm, so trustful and lovely. We had good talks and fun, especially also with David, the younger son who has just 1-2years more than me. This stay with this family - my Kiwi family - was the best thing that happened in the beautiful country, New Zealand. Thank you so much for this time and I hope, one day there will be more!
