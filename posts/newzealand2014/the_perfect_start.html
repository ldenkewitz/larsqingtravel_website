The departure of my journey was kinda bumpy. I stayed for the last few days at the place of my friend Marcus and we were out late every night. Especially the last night we were partying and drank quite a lot. But this in purpose for exhausting myself so I could sleep better during the flight. The departure time was before noon, so we arrived at the airport quite destroyed with just two hours of sleep this night and far too much beer.	He dropped me there and went on back at home. I sorted my things and got ready to drop in the luggage when I noticed, that I'm still wearing my winter jacket, I definitely didn't want to bring! So slowly getting a little nervous I searched for a telephone and fought to get it work with my credit card. After several failed tries, I changed a 20euro note for coins and made it to contact him to turn around and get my jacket. I have to notice, that I left my SIM card at his place and brought only two 20euro notes in total in cash...

Finally he came back and I just threw my jacket on the back seat. Bye bye the second time... Without any further issue I took my seat in the flight to Auckland with a stop-over in Taiwan for about 16h. During a flight I noticed that I sit next to a couple who life very near to my home town and also want to go to NZ to visit their daughter. We had some nice chat and I could suggest them to take the free stop-over-city-tour, Taiwan offers at the airport	for people who have several hours in transit.

A long time later - remember I was very exhausted, but couldn't sleep at all! - we arrived in Taipei and after we approached to the bus tour area, I felt a slight hunger so I wanted to get something...and was looking for my credit card...without success. Now I began to sweat. Checking all my backpack...nothing! Where did I use it the last time? Aaaahhh for the bloody telephone that didn't except it. Oh I left my credit card	at one of the most busiest airports in Europe, Frankfurt, at a public telephone?!? It was also a little after midnight in Germany so I couldn't reach someone for the next several hours, so what to do now... I decided to talk to the other guys I met at the flight, if they could help me somehow, to make a phone call or what. I also tried to show them my (online) bank account to proof I have money and if they maybe could give me some dollars and I would transfer money directly now to they, also German (easy) bank account. He gave me a dollar to call my bank for deactivation of my	credit card but that's all. They refused any further help and tried from that on to avoid me. Hmm...nice people from back home I was thinking. I joined the	bus tour anyway because there was nothing I could do anyway. From home, I just brought a small juice and some little snacks like small chocolate bars or alike,	with what I survived for the day. On the second next flight - we had a quick stop in Australia - I had a chat with my seat neighbour who lives in Auckland. After I explained him my situation and profession as well, he suggested to sleep at the airport and the next day he is going to get me to the city and look	for a job in my profession. He was very sure we'll be successful. So we set the fix.

Arrived at the airport in Auckland, I was speaking with some other young guy from Germany and somehow I also told him my story. He was without any further question directly offering to help, to settle first to a backpackers and then I can sort out my mess. He said, if this is a scam, he would have never heard about such a silly story with such a big afford but little chance to benefit. We left the airport after discussing this.... and getting my mobile phone, I forgot at the plane (!!!).

It took me several days to figure out how is the correct procedure to get a new or at least a substitutional credit card (without PIN / ATM usage). During that time, this guy - Lukas, I was travelling a while later on with - also ran out of money because he messed up his PIN numbers but that's another story. :-)
