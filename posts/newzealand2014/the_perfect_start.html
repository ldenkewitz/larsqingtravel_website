The departure of my journey was ..let's say bumpy. I stayed for the last few days at the place of my friend Marcus in Mainz and we were out every night. Especially the last night we were to a club and drank more than one beer... The idea was to exhaust myself for a better sleep during the long flight and to avoid the jetlag. 
</p>

<p>
The departure time was before noon what meant a very short sleep – it was one to two hours. He dropped me at the airport and went straight back home for further recover. I – still very dazy – sorted my things and got ready to drop in the luggage when I noticed, that I'm still wearing my winter jacket. I definitely didn't want to bring this!! So slowly getting a little more awake by the arising nervousness, I went to the nearest telephone and fought to make it accept my credit card. After several failed tries, I changed one of my two(!!!) 20€ notes I brought to feed it with coins. Ten minutes later he returned to let me throw my jacket into his car. "Bye Bye" the second time...

Without any further issues I headed to the first stop-over in Taiwan. During the flight I sat next to a couple, living close to my home town. They were on the way to visit their daughter in NZ. We had some nice chat and I could suggest them to take the free stop-over-city-tour, Taiwan offers at the airport for people who have several hours in transit.

<p>
Many hours later we finally arrived in Taipei. I was very exhausted because I couldn't sleep at all but also excited and curious for this new world that lay outside of the airport. Slightly hungry I went with the others to the area for the city tour. Still having some time until departure, I wanted to get a snack which I would pay with credit card. <br/>
I was searching for it in my pocket...without success... Now I began to sweat. I checked all my backpack...nothing! Where did I use it the last time? This bloody telephone I fought with came into my mind. Oh I left my credit card at one of the busiest airports in Europe, Frankfurt, at a public telephone?!? That's bad! 
</p>

<p>
So what to do next? I had to disable my Credit Card first, anything else I will manage somehow later. Hopefully! Back in Germany it was around 1:00am so I couldn't catch anyone for the next several hours. Asking the couple I sat next to for some help, he put one, two dollars into a phone which I used to call the VISA service center to disable the credit card. After this "minimum gesture" of help, they acted like they don't know me. Not further help, not even some food.  So much for mutual aid of neighbors. Fortunately from this moment on and for the next few years of traveling, my luck with meeting nice and helpful people had changed a lot for the better.

I joined the bus tour because there was nothing else I could do anyway. From home, I just brought a small juice and a few chocolate bars, which I had to survive the rest of the day with. During the tour we were at charming places and nice markets, offering a lot of Chinese kitchen. Not an easy job for the little footie in me. Hope I can come back to explore more of – as they say – the original China. Luckily Taiwan parted from the main country after the 2nd world war and passed the time in democracy while the continental China suffered from the cultural revolution. In these years, China lost massively it's cultural heritage which survived in Thaiwan.

During the next flight I had a nice talks with my new seat neighbor who lives in Auckland. After I explained him my situation and profession as well, he suggested to sleep at the airport and the next day he would get me to the city in order to look for a job. He was pretty sure we'd be successful, so I agreed.
</p>

<p>
Arrived at the airport in Auckland, I met another backpacker from Germany – Lukas – and for some reason I explained him my situation too. He directly offered his help without any further question and skepticism. I could first settle at a backpackers and then I can sort out my mess. He strongly doubted that this is a scam by saying: „he would have never heard about such a silly and risky story to scam people." Befor we left, I had to go to the lost property office at the airport in order to claim back my phone I left during the last flight. Here he started to wonder too... ;-)
</p>

<p>
In the end everything turned out to be fine. I don't remember having a jetlag the next day the after arrival...but I became a zombie during the day of the flights. I just can't sleep in moving objects or better, in a sitting position. This fact I should experience again during the travel that lay ahead. But remember one thing: Never mess with a zombie!! :-)
