   After roughly two weeks in Auckland and trips to the Waheke Island and the most northern tip Cape Reinga, I ended up in a hostel in Keri Keri. Now it was time to get a job and blend in into the local live. I finished all the bureaucratic matters in Auckland like applying for a tax number and for a local bank account. With this I was ready to perform the reason why I got the work-and-holiday visa. I had two options, either applying for a job like fruit picking which was relatively well payed or wwoofing. WWOOF stands for Willing Worker On Organic Farms, but that's only one synonym but I matches pretty good to the idea behind. It's a platform where locals can post jobs whether it's for a farm or for their private their garden. In common you don't get paid, which is the biggest difference to other jobs. But the usual regulation is that you work 4h a day and get free accommodation and meals from your host. I found the latter option pretty attractive because of the oportunity to live together with a local family, get into the language and learn local customs. Besides this I picked already quite a lot of fruits in my life in our own garden back at home.

   The family I found was living in the same town as the hostel was located in with the cute name Keri Keri. - In fact it's very nice in NZ, that they used MƒÅori names for many places and streets. - It was a pretty big family even though most of the kids already moved out, but they came where frequently for up to several days. That is why the house was very lively, especially because there was a little fellow named "Paddy" who became very jealous when another dog was around.

   Our first stop at the day she picked me up was a local market to get some fresh veggies, before getting home. Then she showed me my room, the very nice house and the big garden they have which was my playing ground for the next couple of weeks. My main occupation was tidying up the garden. They had just cut many trees that were spread around in loads of wood. But the longer I stayed (initially I just planned about 2 weeks) the more jobs I made. In general I had a very relaxed and free live so I could study meanwhile for my diver license (not d<u>r</u>iver licence!) I began there.

   One day during the first week I was asking if I could join someone to the city to meet up my friend Lukas (the one who helped me out). Her answer while pointing to a shelf was: "Somewhere there must be the key for the pick-up." That's just one example of the generosity of them. In general I liked the mentality of the people in NZ. It feels warmer and especially not so fast paced, stressed and superficial as in other "westernized" countries.

   It didn't take a long time and I was integrated into the whole family life. They really made me feel I'm a part of their family with their warmth and love. We had many good talks, cooked and baked together. Especialy with David, the youngest son, I had some trips and activities with, like golf or hiking. I'm so happy that they became a part of my live, even though they live in such a remote country. If someone asks me about the best facts of my NZ journey then the answer is clear: the stunning beauty of the country and my Kiwi family in Keri.
