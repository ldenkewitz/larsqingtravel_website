Back at home, I was going to the dancing school and learned the one or the other dance. In the end of 2013 I discovered a new (for me), very cool dance, called Lindy Hopp. I just finished the first 10 beginner lessons, when I took of to NZ. At the last lesson I met a girl that was already in NZ and Australia. We were talking afterwards quite a lot and then suddenly she remembered and almost shouted very excited: "You must go there!!! Yes it's perfect!!!" Ahm what?! Where do I need to go to do what? Then she explained, at the time she were in NZ she was to a festival of exactly that topic, we were gathering here: Lindy Hopp and Art Deco in general. Let's say, the good old 30th. When she was there, she didn't know all of this, but it was such a fun for her. Now, that I could even participate in dancing it....amazing...! ;-)

During the time I was in Keri, I checked about that event and it happened that it was just perfectly dated for my descending down to the South Island. I wrote to the only contact I could find, that was somehow related to dancing at this festival and it happened that I contacted the right one. She even told me, I got the last free ticket/room. It was a traditional gathering of people from dancing schools in Auckland, Melbourne and Christchurch. We stayed in a backpackers in the centre what was just perfectly located for this event. For the old-timer-parade we could just watch it from above from the balcony. The festival took place over a weekend in February. Next to many many events like steam train riding or watching old Charly Chaplins in black and white, there was the possibility to dance almost all day long. During the days we also had some workshops to learn for example the Charleston. The whole atmosphere was just brilliant because almost every visitor came with old old fashioned dresses and people from all over the world came with there old--timers. They say, this is THE Art Deco gathering of the year in the world. The location itself, Napier, is also just made for this. In the 30th it suffered a heavy earthquake and so they rebuilt the centre of the town in that very modern, up to date, architectural style. That's the reason why you enter another time by stepping into this nice city.<img src="images/newzealand2014/napier_triple.jpg" alt="[Art Deco in Napier]"></p>
