One hobby of mine is pair dancing. The combination of nice music and the expression of it in form of jumping and shaking your body like crazy. No, kidding, not like that!! ;-) I was dancing for a while in Germany, took several classes in pair dancing and leaned the basics of around 10 dances, like Walz, Rumba or Salsa (NewYork style). In the end of 2013 I discovered a new dance I really liked from the beginning on. It is called Lindy Hopp and it's origin lies back in the 30th/40th. You can say it is the predecessor of Rock'n'Roll. The best part of it is it's happy music that just lights you up what ever mood you are in. It's really fun and actually my new favorite.

I just finished the first 10 beginner lessons, when I took of to NZ. At the very last lesson I met someone who was already in NZ and Australia. She told me a lot after the class finished, gave me tips and answered some questions I was curious about. Then at one point she suddenly remembered and almost shouted very excited: "You must go there!!! Yes, it's perfect!!!" Ahm what?! Where do I need to go to do what? She explained, at the time she were in NZ she participated to a Art Deco festival. Art Deco is a architectural style of exactly that time when the Lindy Hopp was THE dance in the western world. Even though she didn't know how to dance When she was there, she enjoyed it a lot. Now, that I could even participate in dancing (somehow!)... and so the only plan I had in mind when going to NZ was born.

During the time I was in Keri, I was checking the internet for some information about this event. That was very naive regarding to the time that was left. When I tried to book, of course all available tickets were gone. But just a few hours later, the person I contacted replied and told me, someone just canceled so there is one ticket. Lucky me! <br/>
I were together with people from dancing schools in Auckland, Melbourne and Christchurch who are gathering every year for this event. We stayed in a perfectly located backpackers in the town centre. To watch the parade old-timer-cars we just had to find a free spot at the balconies of the backpackers. In the picture one can see this few at sunset.

The festival took place over a weekend in February. Next to many many events like steam train riding or watching old Charly Chaplins in black and white, there was the possibility to dance almost all day long. We also had some workshops to learn something new like the Charleston. The whole atmosphere was just brilliant because almost every visitor came with old old fashioned dresses and people from all over the world came with there old-timers. They say, this is THE Art Deco gathering of the year in the world. The location itself, Napier, is also perfect for this event. In the 30th it suffered a heavy earthquake which destroyed the actual center of town. When they rebuilt the houses, they used the state-of-the-art architectural style Art Deco. That's the reason why you enter another time by stepping into this charming city.
