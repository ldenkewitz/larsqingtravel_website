If there is someone I make somehow responsible for my changed life since 2014 is Erik. He has actually a similar life but left Germany around 2 years earlier. With him I had many many talks and even though he didn't intent to convince me to get out of this usual and daily life back at home, he totally effected my. <br/>  
One of the ideas he planted - inception like - inside my head was getting a car in New Zealand, where I can live in. Still being in Keri I had contact to a fellow from Hamburg who was selling his car. He was on his way North, I was soon heading South, so we met up in Napier, the place of the Art Deco festival. He sold me a Toyota Estima with two seating rows in the trunk that have been unplugged. At this free space they installed a frame and put a mattress on top. Underneath the bed you could store many boxes with camping stuff and more. That made it to a perfectly movable living room and my best friend for the next several weeks.

In New Zealand you are officially not allowed to sleep (even in your car) somewhere outside of signposted camping areas. There are even some campsites where you are just allowed to stay at with a "professional" camper. The reason is that such places don't provide toilets. In comparison, in Nelson for example - a city on the South Island close to the ferry up North - is a parking place with toilet for people like me, in the middle of the city. There are also public showers spread all over the country.<br/>
Most of the time I spent the night, or better my car spent it's night at a camping place. There are two essential differences between them: with and without shower and further facilities. The ones without anything are the most cheap and also most beautiful, oftentimes situated on great natural spots. These spot are provided by a organization called <a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/">Department Of Conservation</a>  which does a great job in NZ. They care for much more than only many many campsites in NZ. They also maintain hiking tracks all throughout the country inclusive the huts you can stay at when having a multi day hike. To save money I usually followed the strategy of shower &amp; cooking every second day, means one night at a campsite with more facility and the next one somewhere in the woods at a cheap one. It is just amazing and a feeling of pure freedom to get up in the middle of the nature, doing yoga at a great scenery or jogging along the shore before starting in the day.

With my car I was zigzagging for about 2 month through the South Island plus a few weeks in the North. When you arrive in NZ, the North Island is already very beautiful but you're going to blown away when you make a step onto the southern sibling. I had a lot of hikes in different places and wow...many of them are just stunning. <br/>
Being just with yourself in the pure nature does more than just calming you down. You change partially, you have time to reconsider and to have deep thoughts. Writing a diary in these times is enhancing this process even more - I did it. <br/>

I think this should be the kind of holiday and vacation one has to take in the western, stressed out nations to reset and find back to your true self. In comparison to that, most of us are rushing with some tour providers and folks of other tourists between the so-called highlights like being on a hunting game. Or we relax at the beach or in a x-stars hotel with a cocktail in the hand. All of this is just for distracting ourselves. It is like hopping from one artificial reality-show into another one instead of turning off the TV and to notice how beautiful the silence can be.

The worst thing about NZ is it's remoteness but one the other hand it is also it's salvation. There are many countries in the world housing amazing natural treasures. NZ is by far not the only one, but NZ makes it so easy to access all of it. The people here know about their gem and have set up the infrastructure with hundreds of very well maintained hiking tracks or campsite. After trying to have some hikes in Asia where you mostly need to hire a guide and a porter and to pay a fee, you'll cherish the simplicity in NZ. Just go there and do it by yourself without any hassle. If you need to stay in a hut during the hike, you can buy some tokens that are used everywhere in the country. Easy! <br/> 
Not to forget that NZ offers next to it's perfect climate also many varied landscapes within a small territory. You have beaches, glaciers, volcanoes, plains, mountains and the most beautiful forest you've ever seen. <br/>
New Zealand, when we see us the next time, I'm going to exchange the car with a bicycle...! :-)
