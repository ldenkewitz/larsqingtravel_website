In Napier I bought my car. It was a Toyota Estima with two seating rows in the trunk that have been unplugged of one of the previous owners and instead of this, they installed a frame and put a mattress that is spacious for up to two persons. Underneath the bed you could store many boxes with camping stuff and more. So the whole living room inclusive kitchen was on board. That means a lot of freedom and independence, to go where ever you want. Perfect for	a place like this country. <img src="images/newzealand2014/me_and_my_car.jpg" alt="[Picture me and my car]"></p>

There is one organization that is caring for many many hiking tracks including the huts as well as camping places throughout the country. These, mainly	very easy places, I preferred every second day, because they mostly don't provide a kitchen or a shower. Toilet only. At the other day I spend a night at a bigger camping place, where I could cook some warm dish, had shower and even laundry. The organization is called <a href="http://www.doc.govt.nz/">Department Of Conservation</a> and provide many free maps for different parts of the country, listing all the tracks or camping places. <img src="images/newzealand2014/nz_forest.jpg" alt="[Picture of the forest in NZ]"></p>

With this car I was zigzagging 2 month through the South Island and a few weeks in the North. When you arrive in NZ, the North Island is already very but the pure natural jewel lies in the South. I had a lot of hikes in different places and wow...many of them just stunning. One day I drove along a pass	and together with this feeling of pure freedom, I just shouted and screamed into the strong wind that was blowing there, so excited I was. One main treasure of NZ is it's forests. Such beautiful forests I haven't seen so fare somewhere again, in a comparing climate. Probably you can find other jungle regions that are that stunning too....but there you sweat so much you can't enjoy the track. I tried several ones in Asia and mostly with this result: too hot
and humid. Like this, there are many other facts that play together, why New Zealand is still ranging as number one when I think about nature. But, and this but is written in upper case when you are there....there are billions of sand flies. That's purely the only mood killer in NZ, I encountered. But ok, in comparison for all the advantages this country offers, I would definitely take this challenge again! :-)<img src="images/newzealand2014/nz_beauty.jpg" alt="[Picture of NZ's beauty]"></p>
