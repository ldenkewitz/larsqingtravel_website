<p>Due to the more and more difficult infrastructure, we decided to change out way of transportation towards Tana Toraja and chose mini-/bus. But even this took us a long ride, with a roughly calculated average speed of 30km/h....and this over 14h!!! .....yes, we were thinking about bicycling! ;-)</p>

<p>The few days we spend in Toraja were one of the most intense of this trip. The Torajan people still practice several of there origin traditions. The possibly most popular is there tradition of burial celebrations. These celebrations join (up to) hundreds of guests, family, acquaintances and strangers (like us). You were very lucky to be there at the right time, when such a celebration took place. <br>
So all the sudden, like it had to be, we heard of such a celebration at our first day and drove there with the rented motorbike to participate ... completely unprepared! But like everyone else, they also welcomed us, gave us there self made rice liquor and a fresh butchered meet-dish. </p>

<p>In Rantepao we found a nice couchsurfer who took us around aaaaand....also to another big traditional celebration. It was a house renovation finishing party and these guys celebrate it like someone wan the lottery or alike. Amazing! Seriously hundreds of people gathered at the wide place and next to traditional music and dances, they made a pure massacre. For myself, it was one of these WOW-experiences, but I really don't need a second time...
It was an experience, but also a bloody one. It felt, that for each guest, they killed one pig - and this, next to us while we ate! So actually my usual quite good appetite was somewhere else, but not with me at the very moment. :-P

<p>One day Adolf and me made a very nice trip to a mountain nearby to hike towards it's summit. We saw again many traditional, rural villages, amazing views over the fresh, green valley and the city. During our lunch break in a hut for the local rice farmers, an old grandpa passed by and had together with a couple of kids a seat with us. Eventually he took out a little rhythm instrument made of bamboo and played a sound that could have come from a Australian Didgeridoo. We tried it too but unsurprisingly, failed! Encouraged by his words, if I play it 2 weeks long the whole day, I will be able to play it, so I bought it to add it to my collection of instruments.
