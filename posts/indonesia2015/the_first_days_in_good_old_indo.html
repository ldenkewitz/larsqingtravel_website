<p>As planed at the beginning of this year, Adolf, our Couchsurfing friend from Yogyakarta and me made a trip to <b>Sulawesi</b>. We were aiming for mainly two regions on this trip. The one was the Tana Toraja mountain area, which is rich of unique culture, beautiful landscapes and a very pleasant climate. The other targeted area were the Togean islands in the middle of the gulf (of Tomini), the upper part of Sulawesi is surrounding. There we were hoping for another cultural experience, brilliant beaches and pristine waters to snorkel or dive in. </p>

<p>I flew from Singapore directly to Yogyakarta (Java), where we met last year, when Qing and me were living "on his couch" for about a week. Before we went on to Surabaya to fly to Makassar (Sulawesi), I could enjoy the nice Javanese food again (inclusive my favourite Gudek), some Bintang and a pancake party at his place. </p>

<p>After the arrival on Sulawesi, we hitch-hikied directly the next day to the south eastern tip of the island. 
Because of my Bahassa still sucks, we had the quite efficient team work strategy, that I (the obvious white guy!) attract the cars/trucks to stop, while he was taking the communication and negotiation part. So when we arrived at night in Bira, we set up the tend directly at the beach. Easy!

<p>The next day we continued our hitch-hiking adventure to another town at the sea, where we discovered many traditional Bugis (ethnic group) shipyards. At this place they build everything made of wood from small boats up to bigger cruise ships by there plain hands. Instead of using technology and advanced tools, they still do it in their ancestor way, centuries ago. Very impressive!! <img src="images/indonesia2015/sulawesi_ship.jpg" alt="[Picture of one of the ships]"></p>
