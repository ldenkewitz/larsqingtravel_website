<p>Sad about being alone again, I visited KL for two more days before I moved on to Malacca, to spend almost a week there. <br> I really enjoyed this town, full of colonial history and a pretty nice, laid back centre. There I also met several travellers to spend some time together. For example I went with Jeff from NY to the gym what I didn't do for already a long long time but even this usual and daily activity had a bigger meaning to me. <br>
Another ritual in this week was the breakfast. Day by day I went to the same Chinese restaurant to have super tasty Dim Sum and now I'm not an expert, but at least I know the one or the other, although not by name! ;-) <br>
After this week I went back to KL, were I decided to have a short trip to the national park Taman Negaran. There I had nice jungle tracking full of butterflies and leeches.<img src="images/malaysia2015/dimsum_malacca.jpg" alt="[Picture of Malacca, Dim Sum]"></p>
