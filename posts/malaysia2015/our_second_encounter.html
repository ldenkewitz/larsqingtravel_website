<p>It was around about 7month ago, since we departed but when we met up in KL, it just felt like 3 weeks ago, very familiar and warm. Because the time was short and so nice together, it passed by very fast. <br>
The first day we visited a little Kuala Lumpur and off cause the Petronas Towers to take some silly pictures and then we went on to Penang, our initial meeting destination. There we had great Indian food we even couldn't find in India itself and also some nice city walk. Because our time was limited, we already went on at the next day to our targeted destination, the Perhentian islands at the east coast of Malaysia. There we spend 6days, had several very nice dives and many other nice hours, filled with island hopping and exploration, Frisbee challenges or just snorkelling/swimming in the pristine waters. <br> At the 24th of April Qing had to fly to India and we were departed again for 1,5 month.<img src="images/malaysia2015/qinglars_petronas.jpg" alt="[Picture of Qing and Lars with Petronas]"></p>
