<p>Back on the road, still digesting the past intensive days, we made another easy and nice couchsurfing stop for two days in Poso. After this we partially hitch-hiked again the last part to the ferry town, to get to the Togean Islands. There we spent a great island life, had a real jungle hike to a volcano, had some very good dives or snorkelling trips and every day fish. We also made a little walk to the other side of the island to snorkel in one of these bays. In accompany of us, there were two very cute and nice dogs from the bungalow complex, were we stayed. These two guys were kind of guiding us through the jungle. At the other bay we were snorkelling around when it suddenly became very dark. We totally forgot the time so started to head back, when it was almost dark and we didn't bring any torch or phone. We made it to the middle of the track with the big big help of our two fury guides, when they suddenly disappeared, chasing something. A few moments later, it became clear, they are hunting a wild pig in the black darkness, very close to us. That was frightening us so we hide us somehow behind a palm tree and thought about, how to defend us. Luckily the pig flew somewhere and we could make the rest of the track, with a little faster...heartbeat.</p>

<p>We planed to end these days with a homestay on some small islands, another ethnic group, the seafarer Bajau live. We found a track to such a place and had one night there, with some locals. The next day I felt pretty unwell, but we explored the two football fields big, cone shaped island. During our hike we gathered probably more then the half of the very young population there.
The kids were hanging around with us, playing, singing, dancing. Very nice and cute, so we finished this gathering later on with buying a notebook and pencil for everyone. During the day, my situation became more and more worse and eventually I had to be "evacuated" to a more sophisticated place due to pain, nausea and strong weakness. We made it all the way up to Manado in the north of Sulawesi and I was still suffering. Afraid off the possibility of a second Dengue rush, we went to the hospital to get a check-up and the result: yes, I already had Dengue once, but this time it's a salmonella infection. 
I prepared my mind already for a real evacuation out of Asia at all, because the third Dengue infection is very very threatening, quite often even deadly.<img src="images/sulawesi2015/sulawesi_dogs.jpg" alt="[picture of dogs]"></p>

<p>This marked the end of our nice trip together. Adolf went back at home to Yogyakarta and I went back to Kuala Lumpur with a 2day stopover in Balikpapan (Borneo). But from Borneo I didn't see much then the city, a cafe and my hotel room that I got myself for having a rest while taking the Antibiotics.</p>

<p>Summarizing, this trip to one of the Indonesian islands was a great mixture of culture, nature, island life, camping, hitch hiking, homestay and couchsurfing. <br> See you next time Indonesia, then maybe in ... Sumatra?!</p>
