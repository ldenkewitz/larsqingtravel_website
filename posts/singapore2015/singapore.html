<p>Two days before the departure to Yogyakarta, I made my way to Singapore where I spent 2 fun days or afternoons with the local couchsurfer Pang. Even this fancy high-tech city feels superficial, it is still worth a trip for a few days to get an impression how life could be in this urban city state. Pang also told me some interesting economic and political facts about his home town or home country that all integrates into the more and more establishing big picture in my mind about South East Asia.<img src="images/singapore2015/18697650485.jpg" alt="[Picture of Singapore]"></p>
