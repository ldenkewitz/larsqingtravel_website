<p>Two days before the departure to Yogyakarta, I made my way to Singapore.</p>
<p>
Here I spent a fun time together with Pang, who I got in contact by Couchsurfing. Even though he couldn't host, we met and hang around in the afternoons and nights. He showed me some nice treasures in the city, most important local food - it's just that reason in having some local contacts! ;-P </p>
<p>No seriously, the food was good and in comparison to the rest of the city, by far not fancy. We went together with another Couchsurfer from Korea to the garden district or park or expo...you call it, and at the next day to the super crowdy little India where I ordered his first Lassi.

<p>I'm glad to have met him in this big, superficial city. It made my short trip there a very nice memory. I was also happy to tell him some nice stories about New Zealand and to give him some tips how to get around there, because he was planning to have a long-term-trim too, starting with NZ. As it happens, in time of writing this post entry, he is traveling trough the beauty of this country. Well done! :-)

<p>Even though without having a contact in Singapore, it is still worth going there for a few days. Get yourself an impression of this fancy and surreal high-tech city state, it's really amazing! </p>
<p>Pang also told me some interesting economical and political facts about his home country that all integrates into the more and more establishing big picture in my mind about South East Asia. Singapore had big luck and took their chances in the right time, becoming a world-trade-city. Now in times of emerging neighbors like Malaysia with its Kuala Lumpur, Thailands Bangkok or Indonesias Jakarta, it has to face more difficulties and competition. Especially without having own natural resources makes me wonder, if the current strategy of exporting their high educated labor will work for the future. Good luck!</p>
